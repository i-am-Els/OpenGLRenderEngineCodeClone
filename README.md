# OpenGLRenderEngineClone

This repository houses an OpenGL rendering engine clone developed while focusing on learning Modern OpenGL, GLSL, and the render pipeline.

## Description

The project aims to implement a rendering engine, employing Modern OpenGL and GLSL. It serves as an avenue for learning about graphics programming and render pipelines.

## Dependencies

- GLFW
- GLEW
- STB_IMAGE
- GLM
- ASSIMP (to be used for model loading)

Note: The project is currently optimized for x64 architecture.

## Features Outcomes

- **Modern OpenGL**: Dive into modern OpenGL techniques and shaders.
- **Understanding** the render pipeline.
- **Clear dependency management**.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed above.
3. Build the project using your preferred build system.

### Usage

1. Run the built executable to see basic rendering functionalities.
2. Experiment with the codebase to understand various aspects of the render engine.

### Future Development

- Integrating ASSIMP for model loading.
- Expanding platform support beyond x64 architecture.

*The project is an outcome of a Modern OpenGl Course with some slight modifications of my own soon*.
